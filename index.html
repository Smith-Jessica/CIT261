        <td>This will take you to a page within a website that I created for a different class. This is to show competency in AJAX, JSON and JavaScript Objects/Classes. I understand that there is a *much* better way of doing this and I didn't get the submit portion to work. I used a JSON file to hold the quiz questions and answers. I used AJAX to get the JSON and then parsed the JSON into different objects of the Question class. display the quiz questions after the "Take Quiz" button is clicked. I wish I could have figured out a way to get it to submit via AJAX as well but I figured it was time to move on. If you click away from the page and get lost, you can get back to the quiz by clicking on 'Academics' and right above the table is a link to the quiz.</td>
